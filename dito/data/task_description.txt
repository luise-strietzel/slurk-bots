The image that you see might be slightly different from the one your partner sees.

(1) Decide whether or not you see the same image! 
(2) Once you agreed, you both need to type **/same** or **/different** to end the game.
(3) In case you decide the images are different, please provide a brief difference description together with the command.
(Do not forget the / preceding the word)
