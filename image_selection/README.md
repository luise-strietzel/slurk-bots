This folder contains a selection of image pairs for the task formulation of the Dito game. The images are taken from the CLEVR SIMSG dataset, which can be found here: https://he-dhamo.github.io/SIMSG/. Since there are two different task formulations, there are two subfolders: **form1** and **form2**. These folders contain image pairs. One part of the pairs is in the **source** folder, the other image is in the **target** folder. <br>
In the **form1** folder, all image pairs show a difference in exactly one object. The changes are of one of the following types: <br>
+ object addition
+ object replacement (changes in the attributes of one object)
+ object position

In the **form2** folder are pairs of identical images, as well as images with the change types:<br>
+ object replacement (changes in the attributes of one object)
+ object position
